This is a chrome's extention that supports people stay on focus by saving the distracting links for later on.

Currently, I am working on couple issues to complete the project.

Completion of project is pretty near. Stay Tuned!

### TODO List

- [x] Test local storage chrome API and see how it works (Update: used Indexed DB with Dexie.js)
- [x] Find the way to save link on local storage
- [x] Find the way to save string array on local storage
- [x] Find the way to change the inside of the array
- [x] Make sure the extention works properly
- [x] Make the queue work
- [ ] Go over HTML or CSS to see if the project projects properly on any devices
